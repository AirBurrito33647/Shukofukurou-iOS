Shukofukurou for iOS is the iOS port of [Shukofukurou](https://github.com/Atelier-Shiori/Shukofukurou), which is a lightweight multiservice Anime and Manga library management and discovery app that works with [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/) and [AniList](https://anilist.co/). MyAnimeList and Anime-Planet support will be added in the future when the APIs become available.

Requires the latest SDK (iOS 12), Xcode 10 or later. This app will run on iOS 11 or later.

## App Store Release
Since an Apple Developer Program is required to distribute apps for iOS, Shukofukurou for iOS will cost $2.99 to download, which will have no restrictions and will recieve lifetime updates. The proceeds will go back into supporting the development of our applications. We have to charge for the iOS version since the Apple Developers Program costs $99 a year and we put a lot of work in developing this App. Charging for open source software, believe it or not is [encouraged by the FSF](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html).

However, the source code will remain free for anyone who want it., However, you will need an Apple Developer Program membership to use the application indefinately since Apple limits device provisioning for 7 days on a free account. After 7 days, the app will not run, requiring you to compile and reinstall.

No support will be given to self-built copies. You need to specify the OAuth Client and Secret before you can compile your own version.

## macOS Release?
There is no plans for a macOS release since there is a macOS version, but anyone is free to port it once Apple opens iOS App porting to the Mac in 2019 in macOS Mojave.

## Dependencies
All the frameworks are included. Just build! Here are the frameworks that are used in this app so far:
* ActionSheetPicker.framework
* AFNetworking.framework
* LGSideMenuController.framework
* MGSwipeTableCell.framework
* SAMKeychain.framework
* SDWebImage.framework
